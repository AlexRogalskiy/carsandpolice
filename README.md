# carsandpolice

A streaming example/POC using Kafka/KSQLDB and Spring Boot.

Two types of cars are moving in a "grid": personal cars and the police.

Each car movement is modeled as a streaming event using KSQLDB.

Through a websocket a web client is notified each time a car moves.

POC is work in progress. More documentation will come soon.
